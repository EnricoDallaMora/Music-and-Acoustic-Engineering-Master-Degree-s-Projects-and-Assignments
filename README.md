## FUNDAMENTALS OF ACOUSTICS

The propagation of sounds and vibrations in fluids and solids is at the basis of most of the phenomena related to musical instruments, building and environmental acoustics, noise and vibration from machinery and industrial products. In this course, we will cover the fundamentals of acoustics, starting from the basic description of oscillations and wave motion, the normal modes of strings and membranes, to the propagation of sound in gas media and the description of reflection, transmission, absorption, and scattering phenomena during sound propagation.

##
## VIBRATION ANALYSIS AND VIBROACOUSTICS

The aim of the course is to introduce students to the fundamentals of vibration theory of lumped-parameter systems and to the vibroacoustic analysis of continuous structures. Both analytical/numerical models and experimental techniques are covered and particular attention is given to examples and applications, especially in the field of string musical instruments. Each topic is treated theoretically and pratically, through traditional lectures and experimental/computer labs.
This course provides foundational knowledge on the theoretical and practical aspects of mechanical system vibrations. The first part covers free and forced vibrations in a one-degree-of-freedom linear system. The analysis then extends to two- and N-degree-of-freedom linear systems. The course is heavily focused on frequency domain modeling and the formulation of principal coordinates, based on the concept of natural modes of vibration.
The second part of the course extends the content introduced in the first part to continuous systems and focuses on the structural elements of stringed musical instruments, analyzing how these elements vibrate and radiate sound. The first part is dedicated to the analysis of vibrations in structural elements that can be modeled as one- or two-dimensional continuous systems. It provides the knowledge needed to understand the physical phenomena related to the propagation of acoustic waves and the sound emission of a vibrating structure. In the final part of the course, special attention is given to experimental techniques and numerical methods used for vibroacoustic analysis of string instruments.

## MUSICAL ACOUSTICS

This course focuses on acoustic musical instruments and offers all the tools that are needed for understanding, characterizing, designing and improving them. After describing their structure and function, we describe the physical and mathematical modeling of the sound generation mechanism, as well as the acoustic radiation. We then show how to characterize their vibrational and acoustic behavior through vibro-acoustic measurements. The course focuses also on the electric equivalent of musical instruments. Finally, we show how to characterize their timbral behavior based on techniques of machine intelligence.

MODULE 1: FUNDAMENTALS OF ROOM ACOUSTICS

This course aims to provide the basic knowledge and tools that are needed for the analysis of the various stages of acoustic spatialization in enclosures, from generation; to propagation; to reception; to perception; in various human activities. This course will enable students to gather an in-depth understanding of acoustics phenomena in encosures (buildings, auditoria, etc.) and, in particular, to understand definitions and physical concepts behind the various related acoustic features. Physical modelling and mathematical formulation for analysing the sound will be also covered.

MODULE 2: ACOUSTICS OF LISTENING SPACES

This course is aimed at acquiring the necessary knowledge in acoustics for the design of acoustic environments (buildings, auditoria, listening rooms, etc.) in compliance with the requirements set forth by the community and users. The acquired competence includes understanding the impact of noise from internal and external sources and the use of theoretical and empirical methods to design environment with satisfying sound insulation against noise. Physical modelling and mathematical formulation for analysing room acoustics quality (i.e. indoor sound quality) will be also covered.

## ADVANCED CODING TOOLS AND METHODOLOGIES

Programming languages, which are the elective tools for designing and implementing computer applications, are also gaining traction as cognitive tools that pave the way to unprecedented expressive possibilities. Ranging from scripting formalisms for automating and creating abstraction by controlling music equipment and artistic software, to tools that allow us to perform interactive “coding” for live artistic performances, programming languages are becoming an essential tool for artistic expression and production. In this course we will introduce and work with different languages and the main techniques that will allow us to use them for production, tool design and building, as well as live performance.

## COMPUTER MUSIC - REPRESENTATIONS AND MODELS

Rhythm and tonality are an integral part of all forms of interpersonal communication. Prosody and rhythm in verbal communication, for example, are what charges language with emotional content. In music such elements come devoid of specific semantic meaning, yet they are able to elicit strong emotional reactions. Music, in fact, is the ultimate language of emotions. It comes with a rich language and structure, which is important to understand from a functional standpoint if our ultimate goal is to develop advanced applications related to music. In this course we discuss the structure and the language of music, from early music cognition and perception to harmonic, rhythmic, structural, and tonal modeling. We introduce and analyze the language of music from a “structured” scientific standpoint. In particular, we discuss various aspects of functional rhythmic modeling and functional harmony; elements of structural and melodic composition; as well as elements of arrangement and orchestration. We then discuss how such models can be fruitfully employed to develop advanced applications of music information retrieval, music complexity assessment, stream personalization and more.
